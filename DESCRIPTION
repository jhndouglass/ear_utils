Description: A number of simple functions to perform common tasks. hopefully we
    can share a few bits and bobs here in a semi-formal way (formal enough to
    make code posted usable by other but nobodies going to complain about
    incorrectly formatted code.)
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.1)
License: NULL
LazyData: true
